# Battleship-React
When I first saw React's structure I knew I would love it, as it mirrors how I was taught to build games.
After learning all I could about React I decided to redo an earlier [Odin Project assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship) and make a game in React.

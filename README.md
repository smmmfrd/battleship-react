# Battleship-React
When I first saw React's structure I knew I would love it, as it mirrors how I was taught to build games.
After learning all I could about React I decided to redo an earlier [Odin Project assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship) and make a game in React.

## Story Behind

This is a redo of an Odin Project Assignment that I could not get out of my head. As someone who programmed games I was somehow surprised at the minute complexities found in the rules for this little old game. While working on the first iteration of this project I kept coming up with better ideas and plans, but I just had to finish the assignment and move on.

This project is a result of me taking all those ideas and implementing them, but using the React library to make development quicker and display my prowess with React itself.

## Future Plans

Making games with something that's not built to do so has been a thing I've done since childhood, Powerpoint point & clicks were something me and a friend did in middle school for example. But I have no desire to come back to this or improve it, but if I ever do something with Web Assembly you bet I'll be making a little Battleship game while learning it.
